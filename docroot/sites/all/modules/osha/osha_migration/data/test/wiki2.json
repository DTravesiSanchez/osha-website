The types of measures can be classified as: elimination of the hazards (e.g. designing new work processes) and, if that is not possible, minimising and separating the hazards from the workers by \n:i) technical measures (e.g. encasing, exhaust), \n:ii) organisational measures (e.g. only qualified employees are allowed to do specified work), \n:iii) personal measures (e.g. wearing PPE), \n:iv) behavioural measures (e.g. peer-observation). \nLegislation requires following the hierarchy in order to always select the most effective type of measure. \n\n==What is understood by the hierarchy of prevention and control measures?==\nRisks may cause suffering to people, losses for companies and damage to our economy, and, as such, they should be avoided or \u2013 where this is not possible \u2013 reduced to a minimum. Common sense and legislation dictate that employers [[Occupational safety and health management and risk governance| assess the risks for their staff]] and implement related preventive or control measures. Preventive measures aim at avoiding risks whereas control measures are put in place in order to reduce and manage risks.\n\nTo combat the vast number of very different risks, for example slipping, falling, developing musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), radiation, stress, etc., researchers, technicians and practitioners have developed an even higher number of preventive and control measures. This means that employers need guidance in order to choose the most efficient measure. To facilitate this, measures are classified, e.g. as elimination measures, technical measures, organisational measures or personal measures, and these types are put into a hierarchical order. The highest level is seen as the most efficient one in terms of combating the risks. The lower levels are only to be applied, if no higher level measures are available, or if the application would be disproportionate in terms of effort and achievable result. In most cases, a package of measures should be applied, whereby the individual measures could be attributed to different hierarchical levels.\n\n==The importance of following the hierarchy==\nThe importance of following a hierarchy becomes clear when looking at the following example, adapted from Stewart <ref>Stewart, J. \u2018Occupational hygiene: control of exposures through intervention\u2019, ''Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety'', ILO (Ed.), 2003. Available at: http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/safework_bookshelf\/english\/.<\/ref>. A noisy machine is encased and insulated (technical measure). Otherwise the workers in the workshop would have to wear ear protection. However, not all workers always wear the protection, some ear protective equipment may not fit correctly, and others may not be worn in the stipulated manner. This will render the [[PPE|personal measures]] less efficient as compared to the technical measures. Nevertheless, technical measures also have their shortcomings. They may not be efficient enough as to allow workers to go about their work unprotected. They may be manipulated because workers regard them as interrupting their work process in an unacceptable way, or as too time consuming. Maintenance workers may have to do their job inside the encasing while the machine is running. Therefore, the best measure would always be to avoid or eliminate the hazard altogether. \n\n==Different hierarchies, legal requirements==\nDifferent hierarchies of prevention and control measures have been developed by different institutions. For an overview see e.g. Boyle <ref name=\"Boyle\">Boyle, T., ''Health and safety: risk management'', IOSH Services Ltd, Leicester United Kingdom, 2008.<\/ref>. The BS OHSAS 18001 hierarchy can be seen as a typical system, as presented by Boyle:\n\n# Elimination;\n# [[Substitution]];\n# [[Engineering controls]];\n# Signage\/warnings and\/or administrative controls;\n# [[PPE|Personal protective equipment]].\n\nThe different systems have their advantages and their shortcomings; however, stakeholders should be aware of the legal requirements. These are in the first instance laid down in the EU \u2018OSH Framework\u2019 Directive 89\/391 (see also: [[Legislation]]), adopted in 1989 as \u2018general principles of prevention\u2019 <ref>EU \u2013 European Union, ''Council Directive of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (89\/391\/EEC)'', consolidated version as per 3\/2008. Available under (retrieved 15 March 2012): http:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:01989L0391-20081211:EN:NOT.<\/ref>: \n\n(a)\tavoiding risks; <br>\n(b)\tevaluating the risks which cannot be avoided:<br>\n(c)\tcombating the risks at source;<br>\n(d)\tadapting the work to the individual, especially as regards the design of work places, the choice of work equipment and the choice of working and production methods, with a view, in particular, to alleviating monotonous work and work at a predetermined work-rate and to reducing their effect on health.<br>\n(e)\tadapting to technical progress;<br>\n(f)\treplacing the dangerous by the non-dangerous or the less dangerous;<br>\n(g)\tdeveloping a coherent overall prevention policy which covers technology, organization of work, working conditions, social relationships and the influence of factors related to the working environment;<br>\n(h)\tgiving collective protective measures priority over individual protective measures;<br>\n(i)\tgiving appropriate instructions to the workers.\n\nIn other places, the Directive further explains the training needs and demands that \u2018workers receive health surveillance appropriate to the health and safety risks they incur at work\u2019.\n\nThe first system looks straightforward at first glance, however, it raises a common problem, namely that employers often see no possibility for elimination or substitution. Engineering measures are put in place (or even sometimes just personal measures) and little effort is put into reducing the hazards <ref>Ahrens, A., Braun, A., von Gleich, A., Heitmann, K., Li\u00dfner, L., ''Hazardous Chemicals in Products and Prozesses - Substitution and Beyond,'' Series: Innovation and Sustainability, Physica-Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin, 2006.<\/ref>.\n\nThe second system cannot serve as an easy tool for an employer at a small company as it would need some interpretation or closer scrutiny. \n\nThe Directive has, however, two clearly distinguishable hierarchical levels:\n\n# Avoid the risks or eliminate the hazard\n# Reduce the hazards and the risks\n\nThis means that an employer must not limit the control measures to e.g. encasing a noisy machine, but has to \u2018combat the risk at source\u2019 i.e. consider improving the machine, buying a new, less noisy machine, or searching for a different process that will reduce the emission altogether. \u2018Adapting to technical progress\u2019 is a continuous task.\n\nThe second step \u2018Reduce the hazards and the risks\u2019 has two implications, which are strongly interlinked, and this is unfortunately not really apparent in the first hierarchical system:\n\n* If it is not possible to avoid the risks or eliminate the hazards, then the next step has to be to reduce\/minimise the hazards AND separate the remaining hazards from the workers <ref name=\"South African Unions\">South Australian Unions, ''General guide Occupational Health Safety and Welfare in South Australia'', online training materials. Retrieved 15 March 2012, from: http:\/\/www.saunions.org.au\/ohs\/hierachy_of_controls.htm. <\/ref>.\n\nThereby, for both strategies \u2013 reduction and separation \u2013 technical, organisational and personal measures can be employed, and \u2018collective protective measures\u2019 should be given \u2018priority over individual protective measures\u2019. \n\nAs has been indicated in the example in the second chapter, the manipulation of engineering controls is not uncommon: The German Social Accident Insurance DGUV established that approx. 37% of all safety appliances for metal processing machines in Germany are bypassed <ref name=HVBG> HVBG \u2013 Hauptverband der gewerblichen Berufsgenossenschaften, ''Manipulation von Schutzeinrichtungen an Maschinen'', 2006. Available at: http:\/\/publikationen.dguv.de\/dguv\/pdf\/10002\/reportgesamt-manipulation.pdf.<\/ref>. In most cases, the reason is the time factor, i.e. workers feel disrupted in their work process or they feel under time pressure <ref name=HVBG \/>. Subsequently, the behaviour of workers has come into focus, and some institutions have complemented hierarchical systems by a further level of \u2018behavioural oriented measures\u2019 <ref name=\"Rundnagel\">Rundnagel, R, ''Grundlagen der Gef\u00e4hrdungsbeurteilung (basics of risk assessment)'', VBG, no publishing date. Retrieved 12 March 2012, from: http:\/\/www.ergo-online.de\/site.aspx?url=html\/gefaehrdungsbeurteilung\/grundlagen_und_anforderungen\/grundlage_der_gefhrdungsbertei.htm. <\/ref> , i.e. measures that aim to improve the safe behaviour of workers. These measures include such methods as peer-observation and peer-discussion and need preconditions, such as establishing a no-blame culture among managers and supervisors, and valuing proposals by diligent feed-back <ref>B\u00f6rdlein, C., ''Faktor Mensch in der Arbeitssicherheit \u2013 BBS (human factor in occupational safety \u2013 BBS)'', Erich Schmidt Verlag, 2009. <\/ref>.\n\nFinally, all these measures need \u2018appropriate instructions\u2019 and [[OSH training| training]], as well as possibly health surveillance, where risks cannot be avoided.\n\nBased on the discussion above, the full hierarchical system including some guidance would look as follows:\n\nTable 1: Hierarchy of control measures and guideline\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Hierarchy of control measures\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Avoid risks, eliminate hazards\n\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | \nReduce, minimise hazards <br>\nAND <br>\nseparate hazards from persons (workers, visitors, etc.)\t\n\n| \u2026 by [[engineering controls| technical measures]]\n\n|- \n| \u2026 by [[Organisational measures of accident prevention| organisational measures]]\n\n|- \n| \u2026 by [[PPE| personal measures]]\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Improve safe behaviour\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n\n|- \n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Guidance to hierarchy'''\n\n|- \n| colspan=\"2\" | [[OSH training| Training]] and instructions to be provided at all levels <br>\nHealth surveillance may be needed where risks cannot be avoided.\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Adapt to technical progress, i.e. re-check frequently.\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Before applying measures at a lower level, the possibility of applying measures of a higher level has to be thoroughly investigated. <br>\nIn difficult cases, this may need specialists\u2019 knowledge; data bases, external experts, labour inspectors etc. <br>\nIn most cases, a package of measures should be applied, whereby the specific measures may be attributed to different hierarchical levels.\n\n|}\n\nSource: Adapted from South Australian Unions <ref name=\"South African Unions\" \/> and Rundnagel <ref name=\"Rundnagel\" \/>.\n\n==Efficacy of control measures==\nBoyle discusses the question of how to select the best option of prevention and control measures and presents some criteria <ref name=\"Boyle\" \/>: \n\n* The number of people protected by the risk control measure. In general, it is better to use a risk control measure which will protect everyone who could be exposed to the hazard, rather than relying on individuals to provide their own protection. For example, it is better to put a soundproof enclosure around a noisy machine than to expect everyone who might be exposed to the machine's noise to wear hearing protection.\n* The extent to which the continuing effectiveness of the risk control measure relies on human behaviour. In general, it is preferable to have risk control measures which, apart from any necessary maintenance, operate without human intervention. When a risk control measure relies on the actions of people, it is inevitable that on some occasions it will not be used, either deliberately or inadvertently.\n* The extent to which the risk control measure requires testing, maintenance, cleaning, replacement and so on. All of these required activities rely on human intervention and can, therefore, fail. This reduces the likelihood that the risk control measure will continue to be effective.\n* The cost of the risk control measure. Ideally, the cost should be calculated over the whole of the time for which risk control is required, since some risk control measures have a low installation cost but are expensive to maintain, while others have higher installation costs but are cheaper to maintain. This aspect of risk control measures is dealt with in more detail later in this chapter.\n* And, last but not least, the extent to which the risk control measure reduces the risk. Ideally, a risk control measure, or combination of measures, will reduce the risk to near zero, but this may not be achievable in practice.\n\nThe author concludes: \u2018When deciding on the \u201cbest\u201d risk control measures, we need to arrive at a compromise between all the demands listed above, since they are often in competition. However, a critical issue for a measure's long-term effectiveness is the extent to which it relies on human beings continuing to carry out particular activities\u2019 <ref name=\"Boyle\" \/>.\n\nIn 2009, the benOSH study (benefits of occupational safety and health) established the costs of work related accidents and diseases and compared these with the costs of optimum prevention measures that could have prevented or reduced the incidents <ref name=\"Broek\">Van den Broek, K., De Greef, M., Van Der Heyden, S., Kuhl, K., Schmitz-Felten, E., ''Final Report \u2013 Socio-economic costs of accidents at work and work-related ill health'', European Commission, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, 2011. <\/ref>. The study concluded: \u2018The highest values can be found for measures aimed at substitution or avoidance. The lowest values can be found for measures such as training and personal protective equipment. These results seem to support the case that measures considered to be the most effective according to the prevention principles are also more cost-effective (profitable)\u2019. <ref name=\"Broek\" \/>\n\nDifferent studies have used the hierarchy to classify the preventive measures, for example Transport Research Laboratory <ref>TRL \u2013 Transport Research Laboratory, ''Review of workplace control measures to reduce risks arising from the movement of vehicles'', prepared for the Health and Safety Executive, 2002. Available at: http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/research\/rrpdf\/rr038.pdf&sa=U&ei=oR5jT-XaEsK2hAfQ-52GCA&ved=0CAQQFjAA&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNGtZHZq3VIXhXPKg8dMwpFEVSJWLg. <\/ref>.\n\nThe question of why companies would rather implement technical and personal measures but leave out efforts to eliminate or reduce hazards was studied by Ahrens et al. [4]. The authors concluded that efforts by companies meet a number of challenges:\n\n* Attitude: never change a running process, as process changes may bring about uncertainties\n* No priority neither at enterprises nor in practical governance \n* Dealing with the current problems is already too laborious; no additional problems by an unnecessary innovative approach (existing standards etc.) \n* Uncertainty in risk assessment \u2013 a shift of risks may be possible\n* Substitutes are less tested in practice \n* Integration in the production chain makes an innovation beyond enterprise borders necessary\n* Technological or economic difficulties\n\nThe authors have identified influential factors, such as society, public policy, regulation, market forces, etc. that all have to play a role in order to overcome these difficulties. See also: [[The hierarchy of control measures applied to dangerous substances]].\n\nThe difficulties in applying the hierarchy of control measures in practice have caused the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, EU-OSHA, to provide good practice examples on how to eliminate or combat risks at source <ref>EU OSHA \u2013 European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, ''Assessment, elimination and substantial reduction of occupational risks'', prevention report, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg 2009.

The cases cover different sectors, such as: roadwork, office work, metal sector, railway, health sector, mines, packaging and cement production. A similarly wide range of issues was presented, namely: ergonomics, accident prevention, chemicals, biological risks, psychosocial problems, noise, electricity and climate. The authors present success factors, amongst others:\n\n* Support from top management. This is essential to ensure that necessary resources such as budget, human resources, equipment, etc., are made available for the project.\n* Involvement of relevant actors such as workers themselves (participatory risk assessment), human resources, financial department, OSH practitioners, etc. An important group that has to be motivated and involved from the beginning are the workers. They should be involved not only in the risk analysis itself but also during the identification and implementation of possible solutions. Their practical and detailed knowledge and competence is often needed to develop workable preventive measures.\n* A good analysis\/knowledge of effective potential solutions, best practice and scientific or technological innovations available.\n\n==Examples for systems, machines, equipment, radiation, substances and psychosocial risks==\nThe following table gives some examples of possible measures for all levels of the hierarchy and for different types of risks:\n\n\nTable 2: Examples of prevention and control measures per hierarchy levels\n\n{| class=wikitable\n\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" | Hierarchy levels\t\n! colspan=\"6\" | Prevention and control measures\n\n|-\n!

Kuhl <ref>Kuhl, K., ''Examples on hierarchy levels'', Kooperationsstelle IFE, 2012, unpublished. <\/ref>.\n\nThe examples illustrate that technical and organisational measures are usually twofold: aiming at a reduction of the hazards and aiming at separating hazards and persons. Personal measures can also be used to reduce hazards by e.g. selecting qualified personnel for specific tasks, who use less chemicals etc. The examples also illustrate, that instruction and [[OSH training| training]] are needed for almost all of the measures. Elimination measures, technical, organisational, personal and behavioural measures all need to be explained, discussed, tested and practiced.\n\n==Methods and tools to select control measures== \nAn important method for selecting the control measure is to involve the workers who are actually affected by the task into the risk assessment, the selection of measures and the testing of these. In its campaign booklet EU-OSHA notes: \u2018Workers and their representatives have the detailed knowledge and experience of how the job is done and how it affects them. For this reason, workplaces in which workers actively contribute to health and safety often have a lower occupational risk level and accident rates\u2019 <ref>EU-OSHA \u2013 European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, Worker Participation in Occupational Safety and Health \u2013 A Practical Guide, Bilbao 2012. Available at: http:\/\/www.healthy-workplaces.eu\/en\/worker-participation\/worker-participation-guide#mainContent#appendix. <\/ref>.\n\nThere are also tools available to support employers, managers, OSH professionals, safety representatives and affected workers in conducting risk assessments and in selecting the most appropriate measures.
