Available at: \nhttp:\/\/www.elinyae.gr\/el\/item_details.jsp?cat_id=708&item_id=2171<\/ref>. This framework legislation has allowed the establishment of a number of institutions, like the Hygiene and Safety at Work Committees at the enterprise level and The Hygiene and Safety at Work Council at the national level. It has also defined the role of the Safety Engineer and the Occupational Physician at a workplace. The Presidential Decree 294\/1988 on \u201cThe minimum working time for safety engineers and occupational physicians and their qualifications\u201d <ref>Presidential Decree 294\/1988 on The minimum Working Time for Safety Engineers and Occupational Physicians and their Qualifications [in Greek].

The decree was applied to both the private and the public sector and to all employers with at least one worker. It stipulated employers\u2019 obligations, such as to perform risk assessment, to provide training and to carry out health monitoring. The law stated that the employees should take part of any risk assessment scheme. It also prescribes the role of External Protective and Preventive Services (private companies providing OSH services to the employers).

This Decree obliges nearly all employers to pay an insurance contribution to IKA amounting to 1% of the total wages. Theoretically this contribution is paid for protection against occupational risks. However, in reality the sum is not used for this purpose and is redirected to further finance IKA\u2019s obligations (pensions etc). Given that occupational diseases are significantly underreported, this leads to reduced insurance coverage. A continuous demand by the Trade Unions is the establishment of a Body of Insurance against Occupational Risks under IKA\u2019s umbrella.     \n\n====Other OSH bodies====\n\n'''The Hellenic Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (ELINYAE)''':<br> \nThe Hellenic Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (ELINYAE) <ref>The Hellenic Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (ELINYAE).

Available at:http:\/\/www.elinyae.gr\/el\/item_details.jsp?cat_id=708&item_id=8438<\/ref> describes the procedure followed by the Ministry of Labour for the approval of a vocational training course developed by the above centres. The Council for Health and Safety at Work [SYAE] provides expert opinion before approval of a course. The content and the duration of a course will depend on the target group (e.g. safety technicians working in companies with high, middle or low risk levels, occupational physicians, members of Committees for Health and Safety at Work, employers etc). The law does not prescribe the content and the duration of a training course. Law 3850 also does not foresee additional training in order to face new and emerging risks. \n\n====Other vocational training====\n\nMost of the professional associations have established Vocational Training Centres (KEK) for their members and other professionals.  Many of them provide courses on occupational health and safety. These training courses can provide not only the basic OSH knowledge but also knowledge on specialised matters. \n\n====Awareness raising networks====\n\nThe Directorate for OSH Information Management, Training and Monitoring of Policies on OSH Issues (the Greek focal point of EU-OSHA) coordinates national OSH campaigns and other networking, communication, campaigning and promotional activities on various OSH issues, through the operation and management of the National OSH Information Network (relative information is provided by the Ministry of Labour\u2019s website). The operation of the above mentioned network is supported by its active collaboration and close cooperation with other national networks such as the National WHP Information Network (promoting health issues at the workplace), the Enterprise Europe Network-Hellas (providing consulting services to SMEs) or the national section of the Europe Direct Centres (providing information services to the general public).\n\n===Specialized technical, medical and scientific institutions===\n\n====Research institutes====\n\nThe only research institute in Greece on OSH is the Hellenic Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (ELINYAE). \n\nResearch in the field of health and safety at work is also carried out by research groups in universities, predominantly in technical universities or medical schools, the National School for Public Health (ESDY), Technological Educational Institutes (TEI), etc. \n\n====Standardization bodies====  \n\nThe Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT) <ref>The Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT). Retrieved 18 May 2012: http:\/\/www.elot.gr\/default_en.aspx<\/ref> is the national body responsible for the elaboration, approval, publication and distribution of Hellenic Standards. The elaboration of Standards is entrusted to ELOT\u2019s Technical Committees and Working Groups. Representatives from both the public and the private sector express their opinions on the different issues in order to achieve maximum possible consensus among them. The Technical Committee 59 (Health and Safety at Work) is responsible for the elaboration of standards on OSH issues. The Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Development, the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE), the Greek Chemists Association (EEX), the Greek Society for Environmental and Occupational Medicine (EEIEP), the General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE), the Federation of Greek Industries (SEV) as well as representatives from the private sector provide their expert opinion to this Technical Committee. \n\n ==Institutions and organizations==\n\nThe Council for Social Inspection of the Labour Inspectorate [SKEE]:\nhttp:\/\/www.ypakp.gr\/\n\nThe General Directorate of Working Conditions and Health:\nhttp:\/\/www.ypakp.gr\/\n\nThe Labour Inspectorate (SEPE):\nhttp:\/\/www.ypakp.gr\/\n\nThe Social Insurance Institute (IKA):\nhttp:\/\/www.ika.gr\/en\/home.cfm\n\nThe Hellenic Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (ELINYAE):\nhttp:\/\/www.elinyae.gr\/el\/index.jsp\n\nThe Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE):\nhttp:\/\/portal.tee.gr\/portal\/page\/portal\/TEE_HOME\n\nThe Greek Chemists\u2019 Association (EEX):\nhttp:\/\/www.eex.gr\/Pages\/Default.aspx\n\nThe Greek Society for Environmental and Occupational Medicine (EEIEP):\nhttp:\/\/www.iatrikiergasias.gr\/\n\nThe National Organization for Certification of Qualifications and Vocational Guidance (EOPPEP): \nhttp:\/\/www.eopp.gov.gr\/\n\nThe Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT): \nhttp:\/\/www.elot.gr\/default_en.aspx\n\n'''References'''\n<references\/>"}}}
